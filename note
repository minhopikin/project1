1. Optimize Index Usage
Since the query performs LEFT JOINs on multiple columns, multi-column (composite) indexes can help:

CREATE INDEX idx_prtb_composite 
ON PAYMENT.ram_temp_humana_prtb (seq_payment_header_id, memberid, Cap_Period, CAP_PROC_MONTH, MCO_CTRCT, PBP, Provider_Id, PGM_SOURCE);

CREATE INDEX idx_prtd_composite 
ON PAYMENT.ram_temp_humana_prtd (seq_payment_header_id, memberid, Cap_Period, CAP_PROC_MONTH, MCO_CTRCT, PBP, Provider_Id, PGM_SOURCE);

CREATE INDEX idx_rsrv_composite 
ON PAYMENT.ram_temp_humana_rsrv (seq_payment_header_id, memberid, Cap_Period, CAP_PROC_MONTH, MCO_CTRCT, PBP, Provider_Id, PGM_SOURCE);

CREATE INDEX idx_excl_composite 
ON PAYMENT.ram_temp_humana_excl (seq_payment_header_id, memberid, Cap_Period, CAP_PROC_MONTH, MCO_CTRCT, PBP, Provider_Id, PGM_SOURCE);

--------------------------------------------------
2. Push Down Filtering to Joined Tables
Instead of filtering only in WHERE, apply it in JOIN conditions:

LEFT JOIN PAYMENT.ram_temp_humana_prtb b
  ON a.seq_payment_header_id = b.seq_payment_header_id
  AND b.seq_payment_header_id = '152569'
---------------------
Index Scans Are Used:

PostgreSQL is correctly using indexes on seq_payment_header_id for all participating tables.
However, there are multiple Index Scans and Bitmap Heap Scans, which might indicate an inefficient join order.
Merge Joins Are Used for Joining Tables:

Merge Left Join is used at multiple levels.
Sorting is required before merging (Sort Key), which can be expensive if datasets are large.
This suggests that while indexes are present, join performance could be improved.
