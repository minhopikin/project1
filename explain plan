Explanation of the Optimizations
CTE Usage: Using elig_data and demo_data CTEs allows filtered data to be queried once and reused, reducing redundant subqueries and improving readability.
Reduced Redundant Conditions: With all relevant eligibility data pre-filtered in the CTEs, the updates simply join to the CTEs, minimizing complex conditions in the UPDATE statements.
Direct Comparisons: Using IS DISTINCT FROM ensures comparisons even with NULL values, which prevents unnecessary updates where values havenâ€™t changed.
