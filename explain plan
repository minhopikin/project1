1. Process Overview
Data Archival: Identify and move records older than three years to history tables.
Backup: Dump the history tables to the /pgbackup/dump directory every six months.
Automation: Schedule the entire process using a task scheduler like cron or pgAgent.
----------------
2. Process Design
Step 1: Create History Tables
Ensure you have corresponding history tables for the main tables with the same schema.
Add an additional column (e.g., archived_date) to track when the data was archived.
------------------------------------------
Step 2: Data Archival Logic
Write a stored procedure to move data older than 3 years to the history tables.
--------------------------
Step 3: pg_dump History Tables
Write a script to dump history tables into /pgbackup/dump.
------------------------------------
Step 4: Automation with a Scheduler
Use cron (Linux) to schedule:
Archival: Daily or weekly.
Backup: Every 6 months.
----------------------------------------
3. Monitoring and Logging
Add logging to the stored procedure and backup script to track successful and failed operations.
----------------------------------------
4. Testing
Test the archival and backup scripts in a non-production environment to ensure data consistency and correctness.
Validate that the backup files can be restored.
