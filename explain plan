This log describes a deadlock situation in the recon.RAM_TRACKING_REPORT table involving three processes (406490, 406497, and 406498). Deadlocks typically occur when multiple transactions are waiting on each other to release locks, leading to an impasse. Hereâ€™s an analysis:

Processes and Deadlock Explanation
Process 406490:

Attempted to execute a DELETE statement on recon.RAM_TRACKING_REPORT but was waiting for a ShareLock on transaction 37950774, held by Process 406497.
In return, Process 406497 was waiting on a ShareLock on transaction 37950778, held by Process 406490.
This circular wait between Process 406490 and Process 406497 forms the basis of the deadlock.
Process 406498:

This process was also involved, waiting for a ShareLock on the same transaction (37950774), which was held by Process 406497.
While not directly contributing to the deadlock, it was in the queue waiting for the lock held by Process 406497.
Key Details
The table involved is recon.RAM_TRACKING_REPORT, with attempts to delete rows based on seq_revenue_id.
Transaction 37950774 is holding a lock required by other transactions, and this results in the detected deadlock.
A 45-second wait indicates that PostgreSQL terminated one of the processes to break the deadlock cycle.
Application Logic Review and Recommendations
Concurrency Control:

This deadlock often occurs when multiple processes attempt to delete or update the same rows or when operations are not ordered properly.
Review the application logic to see if the DELETE statements on recon.RAM_TRACKING_REPORT are executed in parallel and target overlapping rows. Limiting the number of concurrent deletions on the same row ranges or ordering transactions could help.
Lock Management:

If multiple operations must delete from or update recon.RAM_TRACKING_REPORT frequently, consider implementing row-level locks or ordering transactions so that DELETE operations occur in a specific order to avoid circular waits.
Optimistic concurrency or handling retries on deadlocks gracefully might also help.
Using Indexes:

Ensure that any columns used in the DELETE conditions (like seq_revenue_id) are indexed appropriately to reduce the lock time on each row.
Batch Processing:

If these deletions are part of a batch job, consider breaking down the delete operations into smaller, serialized chunks to reduce lock contention.
By optimizing these areas, you can reduce the likelihood of deadlocks and improve application concurrency and performance.
