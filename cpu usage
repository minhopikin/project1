Inventory and Assessment:

Task: Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all on-premises databases, including versions, sizes, dependencies, and performance characteristics.
Task: Evaluate the suitability of different managed cloud database services (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL) for each on-premises database.
Migration Planning:

Task: Develop a detailed migration plan, including a timeline, migration strategy (e.g., lift-and-shift, refactoring), and rollback plan.
Task: Plan the networking, security, and access controls for the new cloud databases.
Testing and Validation:

Task: Set up a test environment in the cloud and perform thorough testing of the migrated databases, including data integrity, performance, and application compatibility.
Task: Perform failover testing to validate high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
Migration Execution:

Task: Execute the database migration according to the migration plan, monitoring progress and addressing any issues that arise.
Post-Migration Optimization and Monitoring:

Task: Optimize the performance of the migrated cloud databases by configuring appropriate settings, indexes, and query plans.
Task: Implement continuous monitoring of the cloud databases, including performance metrics, availability, and security logs.
Task: Document the migration process and create operational procedures for managing the cloud databases.
Task: Decommission the on-premises database servers after a sufficient validation period.
